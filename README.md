## About Me üöÄ

I'm a microbiologist/bioinformatician with experience in microbial ecology and epedimiology. I enjoy building analysis workflows that are accesible to people with no coding background, and making resources for collagues to learn how to code! I‚Äôve worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate on diverse projects (in the USA and UK), investigating bacterial and viral ecology (both DNA and RNA viruses) in environmental and agricultural. Currently, I work as a bioinformatician, where I focus on developing code and analyzing data for pathogen surveillance and diagnostics.
