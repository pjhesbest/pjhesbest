## About Me üöÄ

I'm a microbiologist/bioinformatician with experience in microbial ecology and epedimiology. I enjoy building analysis workflows that are accesible to people with no coding background, and making resources for collagues to learn how to code! I‚Äôve worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate on diverse projects (in the USA and UK), investigating bacterial and viral ecology (both DNA and RNA viruses) in environmental and agricultural. Currently, I work as a bioinformatician, where I focus on developing code and analyzing data for pathogen surveillance and diagnostics.

- :computer: Employment: **Bioinformatician in the Diagnosis and Genomic Epidemiology of Pathogens (DxEpiPath) group, IGTP** :es:
- üå± Current project: A **Nextflow** workflow for epidemiological outbreak analysis of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*
- üî≠ Broadly working on: **SARS-CoV-2 and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* surveilance, rapid diagnostics with Oxford Nanopore sequencing**
- üåç Languages: **BASH, R, Nextflow, Python**
- üì´ How to reach me: **phesketh@igtp.cat** || **[Institutional GitHub](https://github.com/phesketh-igtp)**
